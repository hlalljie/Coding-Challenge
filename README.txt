Coding-Challenge consists of two problems separated in to two separate Eclipse Pydev projects.

If you already have Eclipse with Pydev and have python-Selenium installed you can import the project directly into that enviroment to run.
If not here are the steps to take to run the programs:

  The most simple way to run these programs requires only python, Selenium for python, firefox and geckodriver(for firefox).
  1. First Download python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
  2. Then dowload Selenium for python tutorial here: https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html and below
    2a. Run "pip install selenium" from the command line
    2b. Install geckodriver from https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
  3. Run the main files of each project seperately.
